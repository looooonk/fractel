Students will experience the entire user-centered design life cycle, from need finding to usability evaluation. Topics covered in the course include user-centered design principles, usability heuristics, need-finding methods such as semi-structured interviews and contextual inquiry, quick prototyping techniques, usability evaluation methods such as hallway testing and human-subjects user study, and theories about user interaction and decision making. As we are entering a new era of AI, the course will also include a brief introduction on how to apply the HCI principles and techniques to AI-powered systems. This course is project-based. Students will form project teams among themselves to work on a semester-long project and apply the user-centered design principles, theories, and techniques that they have learned in class to build a useful and usable interactive system such as a mobile application. This course is also highly interactive, including a series of design studios and in-class activities that require active participation, communication, and discussion with other students.",

From improving healthcare systems to enhancing the manufacturing capacity of various industrial sectors, the role of Robotics has been acknowledged worldwide. They are now also being considered as necessary tools to build large-scale assistive technologies such as smart vehicles and delivery drones to improve people's quality of life. This course covers topics in robot motion planning, estimation, learning, and control to design algorithms for robots to safely interact with their environments and perform various challenging tasks under constraints. The first part of this course focuses on classical techniques such as search, sampling-based planning, PID control, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Bayesian Kalman filters. The second part covers modern imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning techniques and their application to planning and decision-making in robotics. The course assumes students are familiar with basic concepts in linear algebra, optimization, elementary probability, statistics, data structures, and algorithms. Students are expected to have good programming and software development skills and have a working knowledge of Python.",

The course material is essential for research in theoretical computer science as well as machine learning theory. The course is targeted at students who plan to pursue research in these areas. Topics will be chosen from four core areas: Convex Analysis and Optimization, Spectral Methods, Concentration Inequalities, and Discrete Fourier Analysis. Depending on student and instructor interest, additional topics will be chosen and may include applied analysis, coding theory, probabilistic proofs, and more advanced topics in discrete Fourier analysis. Students will read papers in theoretical computer science and machine learning theory using, exploring and extending the covered techniques and tools. Students are expected to be proficient in probability theory, have the maturity to follow and carry out basic analysis proofs, and have completed courses in calculus, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and analysis of algorithms. More specifically, the course expects mastery of the material covered in Calculus III, Linear Algebra, Probability, Foundations of CS, and Analysis of Algorithms.",

This course focuses on teaching principles and methods needed to design and deploy novel deep learning models, emphasizing the relationship between traditional statistical models, causality, invariant theory, and the algorithmic challenges of designing and deploying deep learning models in real-world applications. This course has both a theoretical and coding component. The course assumes familiarity with coding in the language used for state-of-the-art deep learning libraries, linear algebra, probability theory, and statistical machine learning.",
